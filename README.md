# 🚀 Scrollytelling Portfolio — Sarthak

A high-performance, cinematic personal portfolio built to showcase product thinking, data analytics expertise, and strong frontend engineering.
This project was rapidly prototyped using AI-assisted **vibe coding (Google Antigravity)** and then refined for performance, UX polish, and production-quality structure.

---

## ✨ Overview

This portfolio delivers an immersive **scrollytelling experience** where a scroll-linked image sequence drives the hero animation using an optimized HTML5 Canvas pipeline. The goal was to blend creative motion design with real engineering discipline.

The site highlights:

* 🎬 Cinematic canvas-based hero
* 📊 Featured analytics & product projects
* ⚡ Smooth, high-performance motion
* 🧊 Glassmorphism project cards
* 📱 Fully responsive layout
